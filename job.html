										<blockquote>
										As a Data Center Operations Manager, you will manage a team of Data Center Technicians. You will oversee the quality installation of server hardware and components and take the lead on complicated installations/troubleshooting. The team will install, configure, test, troubleshoot, and maintain hardware (e.g., servers and its components) and server software.
										Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google's product portfolio possible. We're proud to be our engineers' engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.

									</p>
									<p>The advertised position for a Data Centre Operations Manager, overseeing a team of technicians, has responsibility for setup and deployment of infrastructure which provides a sense of achievement through project introduction, install, troubleshooting and completion. It is the deployment and management of a team that would see the software run and be deployed for the end user which ultimately makes the position a key foundational role providing fulfilling experience. 
										<br><br>
										This appeal of this position is working at a reputable company like Google offers industry wide recognition. Whilst Iâ€™m still unsure of my exact ideal job in IT, I do wish to advance general skill sets and if not working for my current organisation, find a position in a reputable company like Microsoft or Google.
										<br><br>
										I currently have a good understanding of hardware infrastructure including server deployment, network and software skills. These will allow for a foundational understanding of some of the requirements for the role. I have also performed several positions in a manager role of small and large teams. 
										<br><br>
										Further skills required will be around UNIX and Linux systems. Further, direct experience in a lower position in a data centre will be required. 
										<br><br>
										To be a competitive candidate for this role I will be required to complete education in information technology system architecture as well as some real world experience in like roles. 
										Post completing the Bachelor of Information Technology, a Masters of Information Technology could be considered with a focus on system architecture.
